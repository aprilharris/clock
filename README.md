<h1>Project Description</h1>

<p>In JavaScript, dates are stored as a number.</p>

<p>JavaScript calculates the date as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 12AM (aka "Unix Epoch Time").</p>

<p>JavaScript determines the date and time based on the number of milliseconds that have passed since Unix Epoch Time: January 1, 1970 12AM.</p>
<p>Date() computes the time based on the user's device. Specifically, it determines the current date and time based on the device's internal clock. If the device's internal clock has the incorrect date or time, then JavaScript might also reflect this. Additionally, results will vary based on the user's time zone.</p>

<p>The script in this project uses the Date() object constructor. The Date()contructor creates a date which we can build upon to display the time, etc.</p>
